# ChIP-exo analysis highlights Fkh1 and Fkh2 transcription factors as hubs that integrate multi-scale networks in budding yeast

The "Data" folder contains the raw experimental data, the processed experimental data, binding motif analysis, the GEMMER database and data from the literature we have used in our analysis.

The "Code" folder contains all Python code in Jupyter notebooks and R scripts to generate to figures and tables presented in the manuscript starting from the "Data" folder. The output of these notebooks is saved in the "Figures" and "Tables" folders.

The "maxPeak_PDM" folder contains a fully functional R script illustrating the use of the maxPeak peak detection method.

See the README in the individual folders for further details.

# Reproduce our analysis offline and in the cloud

Most of the analysis covered in the publication is reproducible using the jupyter notebooks of Python code in this repository through Binder or by downloading the files and using your local Python installation. To start, click the "Binder" button above. From there navigate to the "Code" folder and you will be able to execute the various Jupyter notebooks. 

To reproduce the rest of the analysis simply use the .py and .r scripts in the Code and Data folders on your personal computer.
